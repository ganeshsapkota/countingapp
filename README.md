## ReadMe.....

This code is a Flutter app that displays a score on the screen and allows the user to increase or decrease the score using buttons. The app uses the MaterialApp widget to define the overall layout and appearance of the app, and the Scaffold widget to create a basic layout with an app bar and a body. The state of the app is managed by the _ScoreHomeState class, which defines functions to increase, decrease, and reset the score. The increaseNumber and decreaseNumber functions update the score by calling setState and modifying the number variable, while the resetNumber function sets the number variable back to 0. The layout of the app is defined in the build method of the _ScoreHomeState class, which uses widgets such as Text, TextButton, and Column to create the visual elements of the app. The layout includes a text display of the score, buttons to increase and decrease the score, and a floating action button to reset the score.
